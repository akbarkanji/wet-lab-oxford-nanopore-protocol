🧬 Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Protocol (SQK-RBK114.24 / RBK114.96) – Flongle Version
✅ Materials Required:
Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK114.24 or RBK114.96)

Flongle flow cell + Flongle adapter

Nuclease-free water

Magnetic beads (AMPure XP or equivalent)

80% Ethanol (freshly prepared)

Thermocycler or heating block

MinKNOW software (for flow cell QC and sequencing)

1️⃣ DNA Input Requirements
Use high molecular weight genomic DNA

Input: 20–100 ng per sample

Volume: Adjust to 7.5 µL with nuclease-free water if needed

Avoid fragmentation (gently pipette, no vortex)

2️⃣ Rapid Barcoding (RB)
For each sample:


Reagent	Volume
Genomic DNA	7.5 µL
RB (barcode)	2.5 µL
Total	10 µL
Mix gently by pipetting

Spin down briefly

Incubate at 30°C for 2 min, then 80°C for 2 min (to heat-inactivate)

Place on ice

3️⃣ Pooling and Cleanup
Combine 2 µL from each barcoded sample into a clean tube

Add 1X volume of magnetic beads

Incubate 5 min at room temp

Place on magnet, wait for beads to pellet

Wash twice with 200 µL of 80% ethanol

Air dry (do not overdry)

Elute in 10 µL Elution Buffer (EB)

4️⃣ Adapter Ligation

Reagent	Volume
Barcoded DNA	10 µL
RAP (Adapter)	2.5 µL
Total	12.5 µL
Mix gently, incubate 5 min at room temperature

Do not heat-inactivate

5️⃣ Flow Cell Priming and Library Loading (Flongle)
🔬 Priming Mix

Reagent	Volume
Flush Buffer (FB)	117 µL
Flush Tether (FLT)	3 µL
Total Volume	120 µL
Steps:

Mix FB + FLT gently

Open the priming port on the Flongle adapter

Load 30 µL of priming mix

Wait 5 min

Load another 30 µL priming mix

6️⃣ Prepare Final Library for Loading

Reagent	Volume
Sequencing Buffer (SQB)	30 µL
Loading Beads (LB)	10 µL
Barcoded library DNA	5–10 µL
Final Volume: ~45–50 µL

Mix gently (do not vortex)

Load entire volume into Flongle SpotON port (drop by drop)

Close lid gently

7️⃣ Start Sequencing
Open MinKNOW

Select Flongle flow cell

Run sequencing using the correct config (RBK114.24 or RBK114.96)

🧠 Tips for Success
Use freshly prepared 80% ethanol

Gently handle DNA and beads

Avoid bubbles during priming and loading

Always QC the flow cell before use

📌 Version
Protocol prepared for training workshop participants

Compatible with Flongle, Rapid Barcoding Kit SQK-RBK114.24, and SQK-RBK114.96
