# Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK114.24)

## Overview
This protocol is for rapid sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies Rapid Barcoding Kit.

---

## Materials Required
- Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK114.24)
- Nuclease-free water
- DNA samples (20–100 ng in 10 µL)
- Thermocycler
- MinION/GridION

---

## Protocol Steps

### 1. Fragmentation and Barcoding
- Mix:
  - **10 µL** DNA sample
  - **2.5 µL** Barcode (RBxx)
- Incubate at **30°C for 2 minutes**
- Heat inactivate at **80°C for 2 minutes**
- Immediately place on ice

### 2. Pooling
- Combine barcoded samples in a single tube
- Proceed with clean-up and adapter ligation steps as per ONT protocol
