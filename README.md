🧬 Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Protocol (SQK-RBK114.24 / RBK114.96) – Flongle Version
✅ Materials Required:
Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK114.24 or RBK114.96)

Flongle flow cell + Flongle adapter

Nuclease-free water

Magnetic beads (AMPure XP or equivalent)

80% Ethanol (freshly prepared)

Thermocycler or heating block

MinKNOW software (for flow cell QC and sequencing)

1️⃣ DNA Input Requirements
Use high molecular weight genomic DNA

Input: 20–100 ng per sample

Volume: Adjust to 7.5 µL with nuclease-free water if needed

Avoid fragmentation (gently pipette, no vortex)

2️⃣ Rapid Barcoding (RB)
For each sample:


Reagent	Volume
SARS-CoV-2 DNA	10 µL
RB (barcode)	   1.5 µL
Total	11.5 µL
Mix gently by pipetting

Spin down briefly

Incubate at 30°C for 2 min, then 80°C for 2 min (to heat-inactivate)

Place on ice

3️⃣ Pooling and Cleanup
Combine 11.5 µL from each barcoded sample into a clean tube

Add 1X volume of AMPure magnetic beads (11.5ul) in a MIDI 96-well plate

Incubate 5 min at room temperature

Place on magnetic plate, wait for beads to pellet

Wash twice with 200 µL of 80% ethanol

Air dry (do not overdry)

Elute in 15 µL Elution Buffer (EB)

Incubate for 10 minutes at Room temperature

Pellet the beads on a magnetic plate until the eluate is clear and colorless, for at least 1 minute

Transfer 12ul of the eluate to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube

Quantify 1ul of the eluted sample using a Qubit fluorometer

Prepare Adapter mix:
Rapid adapter (RA)   1.5ul
Adapter Buffer (ADB) 3.5ul
Total volume          5ul

4️⃣ Adapter Ligation

Reagent	Volume
Barcoded DNA	11 µL
RA (Adapter)	 1 µL
Total	12µL
Mix gently, incubate 5 min at room temperature

5️⃣ Flow Cell Priming and Library Loading (Flongle)
🔬 Priming Mix

Reagent	Volume
Flow Cell Flush (FCF)	  117 µL
Flow Cell Tether (FCT)	  3 µL
Total Volume	          120 µL

Mix FCF and FCT gently

Open the priming port on the Flongle adapter

Load 30 µL of priming mix

Wait 5 min

6️⃣ Prepare Final Library for Loading

Reagent	Volume
Sequencing Buffer (SQB)	15µL
Loading Beads (LB)	    10µL
Barcoded library DNA	   5µL
Final Volume:           30ul

Mix gently (do not vortex)

Load the entire volume into the Flongle SpotON port (drop by drop)

Close the lid gently

7️⃣ Start Sequencing
Open MinKNOW

Select the Flongle flow cell

Run sequencing using the correct config (RBK114.24 or RBK114.96)

🧠 Tips for Success
Use freshly prepared 80% ethanol

Gently handle DNA and beads

Avoid bubbles during priming and loading

Always QC the flow cell before use

📌 Version
Protocol prepared for training workshop participants

Compatible with Flongle, Rapid Barcoding Kit SQK-RBK114.24, and SQK-RBK114.96
